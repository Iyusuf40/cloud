Use exporters such as node exporter to export reports
to a central node

You can use ec2 discovery service to automatically add ec2 instances
that are spun up to the already listened for nodes by
- creating a user that can read ec2 instances
- install node exporters in new instances
- configure central node with credentials to poll
  all ec2 instances
